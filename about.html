  <h1> Welcome to my about page</h1>
  <p> Hello my Name is Fenton Clarke and I am a type 1 diabetic. I am currently attending RCC full time until I have an associate's degree. I am not the first in my family to attend college, but I have gotten the farthest out of my immediate family.
    I have actually taken a design class that involved html in high school so some of this is familiar to me. Besides that I did attend and pass a two year computer information systems program at NNTC
    near the Warsaw RCC campus. I have no true career goal but I want to get a degree in either computer science or cyber security.
  </p>
  <p>
    I don't have a school in mind to transfer to exactly. I have three in mind dependent on what I want to do, the three are UVA or VT for computer science or ODU for cyber security.
    I am taking this course because I know that computer science will be different than what I did before and I want to get some experience in it before I go to a four year college.
